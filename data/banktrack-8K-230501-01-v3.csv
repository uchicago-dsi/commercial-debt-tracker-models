The proceeds of the loan were used to acquire certain assets from The Procter & Gamble Company, an Ohio corporation (""P&G"")  and to pay fees and expenses related thereto.  The  Borrowers are subsidiaries of a majority-owned subsidiary of Capital Park Holdings Corp. (""Capital Park,"" ""us,""  ""our"" or the ""Company""), C-PAK Consumer Product Holdings SPV I LLC, a Delaware limited liability  company (""C-PAK Holdings""). C-PAK Holdings is a guarantor under the Loan Agreement.  The  interest rate applicable to the borrowing under the Loan Agreement is equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 12.00% which is payable  monthly beginning on June 30, 2019. Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrowers must repay the unpaid principal amount of the loans  quarterly in an amount equal to $440,000 beginning on September 30, 2019. The Loan Agreement will mature on May 3, 2024.  As  security for its obligations under the Loan Agreement, C-PAK Holdings and the Borrowers granted a lien on substantially all of  its assets to the Lender pursuant to a Guaranty and Security Agreement dated May 3, 2019, by and among the Borrowers, C-PAK Holdings  and the Collateral Agent (the ""Guaranty and Security Agreement"") and a Trademark Security Agreement dated May 3, 2019  by and between C-PAK IP and the Collateral Agent (the ""Trademark Security Agreement"").  The  Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, which, among other things, limit the Borrower's ability  to (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) pay dividends or make certain distributions or (iii) dispose of its assets, grant liens  or encumber its assets. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications.  The  foregoing summaries of the Loan Agreement, Guaranty and Security Agreement and Trademark Security Agreement do not purport to  be complete and are subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Loan Agreement, Guaranty and Security Agreement  and Trademark Security Agreement which are filed as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 respectively hereto and are incorporated herein  by reference into this Item 1.01.  Subsidiary  Equity Transactions  Prior  to and in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Agreement, Capital Park formed C-PAK Holdings and incorporated  C-PAK PREFCO SPV I, INC., a Delaware corporation (""PrefCo"").  Under  the terms of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of PrefCo (the ""PrefCo Certificate of Incorporation""),  (i) Capital Park purchased 10,000 shares of Common Stock from PrefCo for $1,000; and (ii) an affiliate of PLC ECI-Master Fund,  Piney Lakes Opportunities NON-ECI Master Fund, LP, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (""PLC NON-ECI Master Fund""),  purchased 3,000 shares of Preferred Stock in PrefCo for $3,000,000.  Immediately  upon receipt of proceeds from the sale of the 3,000 shares of Preferred Stock of PrefCo to PLC NON-ECI Master Fund, PrefCo purchased  3,000 Preferred Units of C-PAK Holdings for $3,000,000. In accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated Limited Liability  Company Agreement of C-PAK Holdings, dated as of May 3, 2019 (the ""C-PAK Holdings LLC Agreement"") and pursuant to  separate subscription agreements, (i) C-PAK Holdings issued and sold to PLC ECI-Master Fund 1,000 Common Units; and (ii) C-PAK  Holdings issued and sold to PrefCo 9,000 Common Units.  Under  the C-PAK Holdings LLC Agreement, holders of Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive cumulative preferred distributions which  shall accrue on the sum of $1,000, plus the amount of accrued and unpaid preferred distributions at a rate of 13% per annum plus  the LIBOR rate set forth under the Loan Agreement, as the same shall be increased by 2% per annum in the event the Company fails  (a) to properly redeem the Preferred Units as required under the C-PAK Holdings LLC Agreement, (b) to pay the Redemption Price  upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of C-PAK Holdings; or (c) to redeem the Common Units owned by PLC ECI-Master Fund  when and if PLC ECI-Master Fund exercised its right to put the Common Units to C-PAK Holdings, at the then fair market value thereof.  The holders of the Preferred Units shall furthermore be entitled to receive distributions before the holders of the Common Units.  On each Distribution Payment Date up to fifty percent (50%) of any Preferred Unit distributions accrued during the quarter ending  on such date may be declared and paid in cash. For the portion of the distributions on Preferred Units that are not paid in cash  on the Distribution Payment Date, that amount shall be added to the Liquidation Preference and shall thereafter accrue and compound  at the Preferred Distribution Rate.  C-PAK  Holdings may redeem Preferred Units at any time upon payment of the Redemption Price. In the event of a change of control, insolvency,  or liquidation of C-PAK Holdings or any default and acceleration under the Loan Agreement, C-PAK Holdings must redeem the Preferred  Units at the Redemption Price. Finally, holders of Preferred Units may elect to sell their Preferred Units to the Company at any  time following May 2, 2024 at the applicable Redemption Price.  Under  the C-PAK Holdings LLC Agreement, the ""Redemption Price"" to be paid (i) before May 2, 2022 is equal to the sum of  two (2) times  the sum of the sum of (A) $1,000, plus (B)(1) the amount of accrued and unpaid preferred distributions calculated  at a rate of 13% per annum plus the LIBOR rate set forth under the Loan Agreement, plus (2) the amount of the preferred distributions  that would accrue during the same period; and (ii) after May 2, 2022, shall be an amount equal to the sum of (Y) $1,000, plus  (Z) the amount of accrued and unpaid preferred distributions calculated at a rate of 13% per annum plus the LIBOR rate set forth  under the Loan Agreement, as the same may be adjusted to reflect defaults under the C-PAK Holdings LLC Agreement.  Under  certain circumstances of a redemption breach, PLC ECI-Master Fund shall have the right, and not the obligation, to force C-PAK  Holdings to effect a sale thereof.  The  terms of the PrefCo Certificate of Incorporation mirror the provisions of the C-PAK Holdings LLC Agreement with the terms of the  Preferred Stock and Common Stock being similar to the terms of the Preferred Units and the Common Units, respectively. Moreover,  the manner in which the Redemption Price on the Preferred Stock is calculated mirrors the manner in which the Redemption Price  on the Preferred Units is calculated. Once the Preferred Stock is redeemed under the PrefCo Certificate of Incorporation, PLC  NON-ECI Master Fund shall no longer hold an equity interest in PrefCo. Furthermore, at any time after November 2, 2024 through  and including November 2, 2025, PLC ECI-Master Fund may compel C-PAK Holdings LLC to repurchase its Common Units at the then fair  market value.  In  addition, Capital Park and/or its subsidiaries entered into additional agreements, including a Stockholders' Agreement,  Investors' Rights Agreement and Management Services Agreement, each dated as of May 3, 2019, which memorialize supplemental  agreements between the parties related to the transactions described above.

(the ""Company"") entered into a Note Conversion Agreement (the ""Conversion  Agreement"") with SBI Investments LLC, 2014-1, a statutory series of Delaware limited liability corporation (""SBI""),  and Old Main Capital, LLC, a Florida series limited liability corporation (""Old Main""). Pursuant to the Conversion  Agreement, SBI converted $916,666.67 of principal and accrued interest owed to SBI by the Company pursuant to a promissory note  into 54,000 shares (the ""SBI Conversion Shares"") of the Company's Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.001  per share (the ""Series B Preferred Stock""), in full satisfaction of such obligation. Pursuant to the Conversion Agreement,  Old Main converted $733,333.33 of principal and accrued interest owed to Old Main by the Company pursuant to a promissory note  into 42,429 shares (the ""Old Main Conversion Shares"") of the Company's Series B Preferred Stock in full satisfaction  of such obligation. The SBI Conversion Shares and the Old Main Conversion Shares represent 100% of the Company's outstanding  shares of Series B Preferred Stock and until such time as a share of Series B Preferred Stock is converted into a share of common  stock shall represent a class of non-voting securities. The issuance of the SBI Conversion Shares and the Old Main Conversion  Shares will not result in a change of control of the Company.  The  issuance of the SBI Conversion Shares to SBI, who is an accredited investor, and the issuance of the Old Main Conversion Shares  to Old Main, who is an accredited investor, were each exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in  reliance on exemptions provided by Sections 3(a)(9) and 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  Concurrently  with the execution of the Conversion Agreement, SBI, Old Main and Capital Park Opportunities Fund LP, a Delaware limited  partnership (the ""Purchaser"") entered into a Voting and First Refusal Agreement, dated as of January 9, 2019 (the  ""Voting Agreement""), with the Company. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, SBI and Old Main, as holders of shares of  Series B Preferred Stock, have each agreed, among other things, to (a) vote to ensure that the size of the Company's board  of directors be set at, and remain at, five (5) directors and (b) vote in favor of certain director nominees, on the terms and  subject to the conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement. In addition, the Voting Agreement provides that the Company will  have a right of first refusal to acquire any shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by SBI and Old Main in connection with any  transfer of such shares, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement.

(""we,"" ""us,"" ""our,""  or ""Company"") closed on the transactions contemplated by the securities purchase agreement (the ""SPA"")  with SBI Investments LLC, 2014-1 (""SBI""), whereby SBI agreed to invest $500,000.00 (the ""Purchase Price"")  in our Company in exchange for the Note (as defined below), Series A Warrant (as defined below), and Series B Warrant (as defined  below). Pursuant to the SPA, we issued a promissory note to SBI, in the original principal amount of $550,000.00, which bears  interest at 8% per annum (the ""Note""). The Purchase Price was paid to us in full on the Issuance Date. The maturity  date of the Note is June 30, 2017 (the ""Maturity Date""). Any amount of principal or interest that is due under the  Note, which is not paid by the Maturity Date, will bear interest at the rate of 24% per annum until it is paid.  Beginning  6 months after the Issuance Date, we are required to make bi-weekly amortization payments (one payment every 2 weeks), consisting  of 1/12 th  of the outstanding principal and interest, until the Note is on longer outstanding (each a ""Bi-Weekly  Payment""). Each Bi-Weekly Payment may be made in cash, or in our common stock (""Common Stock"") if certain equity  conditions are satisfied. Such equity conditions include but are not limited to an average daily dollar volume of the Common Stock  greater than $25,000.00 for the 20 trading days prior to a Bi-Weekly Payment. If the equity conditions are satisfied, and we decide  to make a Bi-Weekly payment in Common Stock, then the shares of Common Stock to be delivered shall be calculated as follows: the  amount of the Bi-Weekly Payment divided by the Base Conversion Price (as defined below). The Base Conversion Price shall equal  the lower of (i) the closing price of the Common Stock on June 30, 2016, or (ii) 60% of the average of the lowest VWAP of the  Common Stock for the 20 trading days immediately prior to the date of the Bi-Weekly Payment. Additionally, SBI has the right at  any time, beginning six months after the Issuance Date, to convert amounts owed under the Note into Common Stock at the closing  price of the Common Stock on June 30, 2016. If an event of default under the Note occurs, SBI has the right to convert amounts  owed under the Note into Common Stock at 60% multiplied by the lowest VWAP of the Common Stock for the 20 trading days immediately  prior to the applicable conversion date.  The  Note can be prepaid by us at any time while the Note is outstanding, at a prepayment price of 125% multiplied by the outstanding  principal and interest of the Note, subject to SBI's discretionary acceptance. If an event of default occurs under the Note,  which is not cured within 10 business days after SBI's notice to us of such event of default, SBI has the option to require  our redemption of the Note in cash at a redemption price of 130% multiplied by the outstanding principal and interest of the Note.  The Note contains representations, warranties, events of default, beneficial ownership limitations, and other provisions that  are customary of similar instruments.  In  conjunction with the issuance of the Note, we simultaneously issued to SBI a Series A warrant to purchase 125,000 shares of Common  Stock (the ""Series A Warrant"") and Series B warrant to purchase 125,000 shares of Common Stock (the ""Series  B Warrant""). The Warrants may be exercised by SBI at any time in the 3 year period following the Issuance Date. The exercise  price for each share of the Common Stock under the Series A Warrant is equal to $0.082, subject to certain adjustments as provided  therein. The exercise price for each share of the Common Stock under the Series B Warrant is equal to $0.096, subject to certain  adjustments as provided therein.  We  claim an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, for the private placement of these securities pursuant  to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder because, among other things, the transaction  did not involve a public offering, SBI is an accredited investor, SBI acquired the securities for investment and not resale, and  we took appropriate measures to restrict the transfer of the securities.

The conversion is subject  to the ownership limitations contained in the Agreement, which provide that Glamis shall not be entitled to convert its portion  of the Note in excess of that portion of the Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the number of shares of Company common  stock beneficially owned by Glamis and its affiliates and (2) the number of shares of Company commons stock issuable upon the  conversion of the portion of the Note with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial  ownership by Glamis and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the Company's outstanding shares at that time.

Subsequently, the parties agreed that the amended and restated First C5 Note and any future notes to be issued in connection with additional bridge financing by C5 would be convertible into shares of the Company's common stock. On January 11, 2023, the Company issued to C5 an amended and restated convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $2.0 million (the "" Restated C5 Note "").

The Restated C5 Note and the Second C5 Note (collectively, the "" C5 Notes ""), in the aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million, are in substantially the form of secured convertible promissory note attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1.

Commencement of the exclusivity period was subject to C5 providing the $2.0 million of bridge financing described in Item 1.01 above. Continuation of the exclusivity period after January 9, 2023 is subject to C5 entering into additional Restated Notes providing $3.5 million of additional bridge financing by January 9, 2023. The January 31, 2023 expiration date is subject to an automatic extension of an additional seven days if C5 provides additional bridge financing sufficient to fund the Company's operations for such  seven-day  period (up to a maximum additional amount of $3.5 million).    The Company plans to use the proceeds of the Restated Notes to fund its ongoing operations. However, management anticipates that, in the absence of additional sources of liquidity (which may include additional Restated Notes to be issued to C5 as described in the preceding paragraph), the Company's existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operations will not be sufficient to meet the Company's operating and liquidity needs through the end of January 2023.    In the event the Company does not issue any additional Restated Notes to C5 and determines that additional sources of liquidity will not be available to it or will not allow it to meet its obligations as they become due, the Company may need to file a voluntary petition for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code in order to implement a plan of reorganization, court-supervised sale and/or liquidation. Furthermore, in the event the Company is unable to pursue bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, it may be necessary to pursue bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, in which case a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate the Company's assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Company expects that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to stakeholders than those it might obtain under Chapter 11 primarily because of the likelihood that the Company's assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of by a Chapter 7 trustee in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than sold by existing management as a going concern business. In the event that the Company pursues bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7, the Company's material business activities will cease, and the Company will no longer have the capability to prepare financial statements and other disclosures required for periodic reports for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company expects that no distributions would be available for stockholders in a Chapter 7 liquidation.  Forward-Looking Statements    Certain statements in this Current Report on Form  8-K  may be considered forward-looking statements, including statements with respect to the negotiation of definitive agreements with C5 for the acquisition of the Company and the Company's expectations with respect to the sufficiency of the Company's cash resources and the ability to secure additional sources of liquidity, including the issuance of additional Restated Notes to C5, the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and the potential need to pursue bankruptcy protection.

For any Installment Amount paid in cash, the price paid will be equal to 105% of the Installment Amount.    If, at any time while any Convertible Note is outstanding, the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall carry out certain Common Stock and/or Common Stock equivalent financing transactions in excess of $5,000,000 in gross proceeds, the Investor shall have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to require the Company to first use up to 30% of the net proceeds of such financing to redeem all or a portion of such Convertible Note for an amount in cash equal to 105% of the sum of (i) the principal amount of such Convertible Note subject to such redemption, plus (ii) accrued but unpaid interest on the Convertible Note subject to such redemption, plus (iii) any other amounts, if any, then owing to the Investor in respect of such Convertible Note (the "" Redemption Price "").    In connection with a ""Change of Control"" (as defined in the Convertible Notes), the Investor shall have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to require the Company to redeem all or any portion of the Convertible Notes in cash at a price equal to the Redemption Price.

The amount available to be drawn under the Credit Agreement may be increased by an additional $100 million upon our request and the agreement of the lenders party to the Credit  Agreement.  Each of the Company, Higher One Machines, Inc., Higher One Real Estate, Inc. and Higher One Real Estate SP, LLC (collectively, together with Higher One, the ""Loan Parties"") is a guarantor of Higher One's obligations under the Credit Agreement.  Loans drawn under the Credit Agreement are secured by a perfected first priority security interest in all of the capital stock of Higher One and its domestic subsidiaries, and substantially all of each Loan Party's tangible and intangible assets, including intellectual property.  Borrowings by Higher One under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes.  The Credit Agreement also permits the issuance of letters of credit of up to $20 million and swing line loans of up to $10 million to fund working capital needs.  The loans drawn under the Credit Agreement are payable in a single maturity on October 16, 2017.  As of October 17, 2012, Higher One had $30 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

On March 25, 2020, the order was modified and superseded by a new SEC order (Release No. 34-88465), or the SEC Order, that provides conditional relief to public companies that are unable to timely comply with their filing obligations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Fuse Group Holding Inc. (the ""Company"") is relying on the SEC Order to delay the filing of its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, or the Quarterly Report, due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The state of California, where the Company is headquartered, has been affected by COVID-19. The Governor of California has issued a stay-at-home order, which took effect on March 19, 2020. Substantially all of the Company's workforce is currently working from home either all or substantially all of the time, including the Company's limited number of general administrative and accounting personnel. These safety measures have restricted access to the Company's facilities and books and records, and have disrupted routine interactions among the Company's staff, advisors and third parties involved in the preparation of the Quarterly Report. Due to these disruptions, the Company is unable to timely file its Quarterly Report, originally due on May 15, 2020. The Company expects to file the Quarterly Report on or before June 29, 2020, which is 45 days after the original filing deadline of the Quarterly Report.  The Company is supplementing its risk factors previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019 with the following risk factor:  An occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations and financial results .  In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, COVID-19 has spread to multiple countries, including the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the U.S. government imposed travel restrictions on travel between the United States, China and certain other countries. Further, the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency, invoking powers under the Stafford Act, the legislation that directs federal emergency disaster response. Similarly, the Governor of California has issued a stay-at-home order closing all non-essential businesses, which took effect on March 19, 2020.  Our business and services and results of operations have been adversely affected and could continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Substantially all of our workforce is now working from home either all or substantially all of the time. The effects of the California order and our work-from-home policies have negatively impacted our business development, and disrupted or delayed our current mine projects and services to our clients, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.  Quarantines, travel restrictions, shelter-in-place and other restrictions related to COVID-19 have impacted our abilities to visit mines in Mexico and Asian counties as well as meeting with potential clients and miner owners for our consulting business and our own investment in mine projects. Our clients that are negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 may cancel or suspend their mine acquisition projects, which in turn will reduce their demands for our services and materially adversely impact our revenue.  The global economy has also been materially negatively affected by COVID-19 and there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of its impacts. The U.S. and global growth forecast is extremely uncertain, which would seriously affect people's investment desires in mines in Mexico, Asia and internationally.  While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.  Further, as we do not have access to a revolving credit facility, there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure commercial debt financing in the future in the event that we require additional capital. We currently believe that our financial resources will be adequate to see us through the outbreak. However, in the event that we do need to raise capital in the future, the outbreak-related instability in the securities markets could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.  In general, our business could be adversely affected by the effects of epidemics, including, but not limited to, COVID-19, avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the influenza A virus, the Ebola virus, or other outbreaks. In response to an epidemic or other outbreaks, government and other organizations may adopt regulations and policies that could lead to severe disruption to our daily operations, including temporary closure of our offices and other facilities. These severe conditions may cause us and/or our business partners to make internal adjustments, including but not limited to, temporarily closing down business, limiting business hours, and setting restrictions on travel and/or visits with clients and partners for a prolonged period of time. Various impacts arising from severe conditions may cause business disruption, resulting in material adverse effects to our financial condition and results of operations.

These complaints allege that the preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus or the Definitive Proxy Statement filed by ConocoPhillips misstated or omitted material information regarding the parties' financial projections, the analyses performed by Concho's and ConocoPhillips' respective financial advisors, potential conflicts of interest involving Concho's and ConocoPhillips' respective financial advisors and/or the sales process leading up to the Merger, and that disclosure of material information is necessary for Concho's and ConocoPhillips' stockholders to make informed decisions regarding whether to vote in favor of the Merger or the issuance of shares of ConocoPhillips common stock in connection with the Merger (the "" Share Issuance ""). Other than the Davydov lawsuit, the complaints further allege that Concho's or ConocoPhillips' directors and/or ConocoPhillips are liable for alleged violations as ""controlling persons"" of Concho and ConocoPhillips under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Garfield lawsuit alleges, among other things, that ConocoPhillips and the directors of ConocoPhillips disseminated a Definitive Proxy Statement that contains materially false and misleading statements and omissions in violation of Texas common law. The complaint alleges that the Definitive Proxy Statement included false or misleading statements regarding conflicts of interests of those promoting the Merger, as well as financial information underlying the analyses conducted by ConocoPhillips' financial advisor in formulating its fairness opinion, and that disclosure of material information is necessary for ConocoPhillips' stockholders to make informed decisions regarding whether to vote in favor of the Share Issuance. Among other relief, the complaints seek injunctive relief, including enjoining the Merger unless and until the Defendants disclose the allegedly omitted material information, rescinding the Merger in the event the Defendants consummate the Merger (or awarding rescissory damages), damages, and an award of attorneys' and experts' fees. ConocoPhillips and Concho believe that the claims in the complaints are without merit and that no further disclosure is required under applicable law.    As a result of supplemental disclosures set forth herein, the plaintiff in the Garfield lawsuit has entered into an agreement to voluntarily dismiss his action with prejudice.    Supplemental Disclosures to Definitive Proxy Statement    This supplemental information to the Definitive Proxy Statement should be read in conjunction with the Definitive Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of any of the disclosures set forth herein. All page references in the information below are to pages in the Definitive Proxy Statement, and all terms used but not defined below shall have the meanings set forth in the Definitive Proxy Statement.    The following underlined language is added to the second full paragraph in the section of the Definitive Proxy Statement entitled ""The Merger--Opinion of Goldman Sachs, ConocoPhillips' Financial Advisor-- Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis--Concho Standalone "" that appears on pages  94-95.     Using discount rates ranging from 5.5% to 7.5%, reflecting estimates of Concho's weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of June 30, 2020 (i) estimates of the unlevered free cash flows to be generated by Concho on a standalone basis for the period from June 30, 2020 to December 31, 2025, as reflected in the forecasts for Concho, and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Concho as of December 31, 2025, calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from (0.5)% to 0.5% to the estimate of the terminal year unlevered free cash flow of Concho, as reflected in the forecasts for Concho (which analysis implied multiples of the implied terminal values derived for Concho to estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense (which we refer to as ""EBITDA"") for Concho, as reflected in the forecasts for Concho, for 2025, ranging from 3.9x to 6.3x). Goldman Sachs derived the discount rates referenced above by application of the capital asset pricing model (which we refer to as ""CAPM""), which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company's target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the forecasts for Concho on a standalone basis and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for Concho by adding the ranges of present values it derived as described above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived the net debt of Concho as of June 30, 2020, as reflected in Concho's consolidated balance sheet as of that date, adjusted  by approximately $100  million  to reflect Concho's public offering of its 2.400% Senior Notes in August 2020 and redemption of its 4.375% Senior Notes in September 2020, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Concho. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived for Concho on a standalone basis by the fully diluted shares of Concho common stock outstanding as of October 16, 2020, calculated based on equity information provided by Concho management and approved for standalone basis, for 2025, ranging from 4.3x to 7.3x).

The following underlined language is added to the first full paragraph in the section of the Definitive Proxy Statement entitled ""The Merger--Opinion of Credit Suisse, Concho's Financial Advisor-- Selected Company Analysis "" that appears on pages  107-108.     Credit Suisse considered certain financial data for Concho, ConocoPhillips and selected companies with publicly traded equity securities Credit Suisse deemed relevant. The selected companies were selected because they were deemed to be similar to Concho and ConocoPhillips in one or more respects. For purposes of these analyses, (1) Credit Suisse was directed by Concho to use the Concho projections (Case A) and the Concho projections for ConocoPhillips (Case A)  given that the scenarios contemplated by Case A were considered by Concho management to most closely resemble then current market conditions and near-term production growth profiles , (2) except as otherwise noted, share prices for the selected companies were closing prices as of October 16, 2020 and (3) estimates of future financial performance for the selected companies for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2022 used to select the implied multiple ranges were based on publicly available research analyst estimates for those companies.    The following underlined language is added to the first two full paragraphs in the section of the Definitive Proxy Statement entitled ""The Merger--Opinion of Credit Suisse, Concho's Financial Advisor-- Discounted Cash Flow   Analysis "" that appear on pages  109-110.     Concho . Credit Suisse performed a discounted cash flow analysis with respect to Concho by calculating the estimated net present value of the projected  after-tax,  unlevered, free cash flows of Concho based on each of the four cases described above comprising the Concho projections. Credit Suisse applied , based on its professional judgment and experience,  terminal multiples of  5.0x-6.0x  to Concho's estimated EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2030 based on each case of the Concho projections  to estimate a range of terminal values  and discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 11.0% to the projected unlevered free cash flows and calculated terminal values.  Credit Suisse derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Concho for each case by adding the ranges of present values it derived as described above. Credit Suisse then subtracted, from the ranges of illustrative enterprise values it derived, as directed by Concho management, estimates of applicable corporate adjustments, including net debt, of Concho as of December  31, 2020 provided by Concho management. Credit Suisse derived the discount rates referenced above, reflecting estimates of weighted average cost of capital for Concho, by application of the capital asset pricing model . The discounted cash flow analysis for Concho indicated implied reference ranges per share of Concho common stock of $38.37 to $54.74 for Case A, $93.23 to 121.69 for Case B, $28.22 to $38.55 for Case C, and $67.38 to $85.15 for Case D.    ConocoPhillips . Credit Suisse performed a discounted cash flow analysis with respect to ConocoPhillips by calculating the estimated net present value of the projected  after-tax,  unlevered, free cash flows of ConocoPhillips based on each of the four cases described above comprising the Concho projections for ConocoPhillips. Credit Suisse applied , based on its professional judgment and experience,  terminal multiples of  6.0x-  7.0x to ConocoPhillips' estimated EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2030 based on each case of the Concho projections for ConocoPhillips  to estimate a range of terminal values  and discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 10.0% to the projected unlevered free cash flows and calculated terminal values.  Credit Suisse derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for ConocoPhillips for each case by adding the ranges of present values it derived as described above. Credit Suisse then subtracted, from the ranges of illustrative enterprise values it derived, as directed by Concho management, estimates of applicable corporate adjustments, including net debt, of ConocoPhillips as of December  31, 2020 provided by ConocoPhillips management. Credit Suisse derived the discount rates referenced above, reflecting estimates of weighted average cost of capital for ConocoPhillips, by application of the capital asset pricing model . The discounted cash flow analysis for ConocoPhillips indicated implied reference ranges per share of ConocoPhillips common stock of $24.48 to $33.07 for Case A, $62.94 to $78.33 for Case B, $20.15 to $26.60 for Case C, and $53.27 to $64.98 for Case D. While the ConocoPhillips projections were based on differing oil price and production growth assumptions than the Concho projections for ConocoPhillips and consequently were not directly comparable to the Concho projections for ConocoPhillips, Credit Suisse also performed a discounted cash flow analysis with respect to ConocoPhillips based on the ConocoPhillips projections using terminal multiples of 6.0x to 7.0x and discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 10.0%, which indicated an implied reference range per share of ConocoPhillips common stock of $52.19 and $65.97.

The words estimate,  project, predict, believe, expect, anticipate, potential, could, may, foresee, plan, will, guidance,  outlook, goal or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. However, the absence of  these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company based on managements experience, expectations and perception of historical trends,  current conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking  statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. The guidance  capital program and outlook presented herein are subject to change by the Company without notice and the Company has no obligation to affirm or update such information, except as required by law. Moreover, such statements are subject to a number of  assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company,  3  which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. These include the risk factors discussed or referenced in the Companys  most recent Annual Report on Form  10-K;  Quarterly Reports on Form  10-Q  and Current Reports on Forms  8-K;  risks associated with  the Companys proposed merger with RSP, including increased expenses, management distraction from the Companys business, declines in the market price of the Companys common stock and failure to realize the expected benefits of the  transaction; failure, difficulties and delays in meeting conditions required for closing set forth in the RSP merger agreement; risks associated with acquisitions, including liabilities associated with acquired properties or businesses and the  ability to realize expected benefits; disruptions to, capacity constraints in or other limitations on the pipeline systems that deliver the Companys oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas and other processing and transportation  considerations; declines in, or the sustained depression of, the prices we receive for the Companys oil and natural gas; risks related to the concentration of the Companys operations in the Permian Basin of southeast New Mexico and west  Texas; evolving cybersecurity risks, such as those involving unauthorized access,  denial-of-service  attacks, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees,  insiders or others with authorized access, cyber or phishing-attacks, ransomware, malware, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions; the costs and availability of equipment, resources, services and qualified personnel required to  perform the Companys drilling, completion and operating activities; drilling, completion and operating risks; environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the  environment, including groundwater contamination; the effects of government regulation, permitting and other legal requirements, including new legislation or regulation related to hydraulic fracturing, climate change, derivatives reform or the  export of oil and natural gas; the impact of current and potential changes to federal or state tax rules and regulations, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; potential financial losses or earnings reductions from the Companys commodity price  risk-management program; difficult and adverse conditions in the domestic and global capital and credit markets; the adequacy of the Companys capital resources and liquidity including, but not limited to, access to additional borrowing  capacity under the Companys credit facility; the impact of potential changes in the Companys credit ratings; uncertainties about the Companys ability to successfully execute the Companys business and financial plans and  strategies; uncertainties about the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves; uncertainties about the Companys ability to replace reserves and economically develop the Companys current reserves; general economic and business  conditions, either internationally or domestically; competition in the oil and natural gas industry; and uncertainty concerning the Companys assumed or possible future results of operations; and other important factors that could cause actual  results to differ materially from those projected.    Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the  Company undertakes no obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.  Cautionary Statements Regarding Resource    Concho may use  the term resource potential and similar phrases to describe estimates of potentially recoverable hydrocarbons that SEC rules prohibit from being included in filings with the SEC. These are based on analogy to Conchos existing  models applied to additional acres, additional zones and tighter spacing and are Conchos internal estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be potentially discovered through exploratory drilling or recovered with additional drilling or  recovery techniques. These quantities may not constitute reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Petroleum Resource Management System or SEC rules. Such estimates and identified drilling locations have not  been fully risked by Concho management and are inherently more speculative than proved reserves estimates. Actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered from Conchos interests could differ substantially from these  estimates. There is no commitment by Concho to drill all of the drilling locations that have been attributed to these quantities. Factors affecting ultimate recovery  4  include the scope of Conchos ongoing drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and  equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals, actual drilling results, including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates, and other factors. Such estimates may change  significantly as development of Conchos oil and natural gas assets provide additional data. Conchos production forecasts and expectations for future periods are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline  rates from existing wells and the undertaking and outcome of future drilling activity, which may be affected by significant commodity price declines or drilling cost increases or other factors that are beyond Conchos control. Conchos use  of the term premium resource refers to assets with the capacity to produce at an internal rate of return that is greater than thirty-five percent based on fifty-five dollar oil and three dollar gas.  5",000119312518193102-8.01,8.01

Prior to effectiveness of the Eleventh Amendment, the Company was prohibited from issuing unsecured notes in excess of $4.0 billion, and  any issuance of unsecured notes after November 2, 2013 would have resulted in a reduction in the Companys borrowing base equal to the lesser of (i) $300 for every $1,000 of aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes issued  by the Company or (ii) such other amount, if any, as determined prior to the issuance of such notes by lenders holding at least two-thirds of the outstanding credit exposure and unused commitments under the Amended and Restated Credit  Agreement. The Eleventh Amendment removes the $4.0 billion limit on the Companys ability to issue unsecured notes as well as the provision requiring that any issuance of unsecured notes after November 2, 2013 would result in a reduction  of the borrowing base under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.    The Eleventh Amendment also allows the Company to make  restricted payments in an aggregate amount up to $250.0 million plus (i) 50% of the Companys consolidated net income (or, in the case of a consolidated net loss, minus 100% of such deficit) beginning January 1, 2013 and (ii) 66  2/3% of the aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Company from any issuances of shares of common stock on or after January 1, 2013.

The Eleventh Amendment permits the Company to enter into commodities hedging arrangements with aggregate notional volume for any given month that do not exceed (i) 90% of the  Companys forecasted production of oil and natural gas reserves, based on internal engineering reports, for any given month during the succeeding one-year period and (ii) 80% of the Companys forecasted production of oil and natural  gas reserves, based on internal engineering reports, for any given month during the remaining four years of the succeeding five-year period. In addition, the Eleventh Amendment provides that the Company may enter into commodities hedging  arrangements covering up to 70% of its forecasted production of oil and natural gas reserves, based on internal engineering reports, with respect to estimated reserves to be acquired in connection with certain acquisitions.  Finally, the Eleventh Amendment reaffirms the Companys current borrowing base of $3.0 billion and maintains the lenders  aggregate commitments of $2.5 billion under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

Gray, LLC, a New Mexico limited  liability company ( JRG LLC  and, collectively with Marbob, Pitch and Costaplenty, the  Sellers )  to acquire (the  Acquisition ) substantially all of the Sellers oil and gas leases, interests,  properties and related assets for aggregate consideration of approximately $1.65 billion, subject  to purchase price adjustments. The consideration consists of (i) cash consideration in the  aggregate amount of $1.45 billion, (ii) the issuance to Pitch of an unsecured promissory note (the  Note ) in the aggregate principal amount of $150 million and (iii) the issuance to Pitch of  1,103,752 shares of the Companys common stock for a negotiated  price of $45.30 per share.  The issuance of the Note and the shares of common stock to Pitch is being made in reliance on an  exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to Section 4(2)  thereof.  The Company intends to finance the Acquisition with proceeds raised from a $300 million private  placement of the Companys common stock, as further described below, together with funds expected  to be available under its amended and restated senior credit facility following an amendment to be  arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A. and Banc  of America Securities LLC, each of which has delivered lending commitments (the  Commitments ) to  the Company. The Company expects the Acquisition to close on or before November 30, 2010, subject  to due diligence to be performed by the Company and the satisfaction of the other closing  conditions of the parties, as further described below.  Before the closing, the Company intends to conduct customary due diligence of the Sellers assets  to assess material title deficiencies and environmental matters. If, prior to the closing, the  parties ultimately determine that the aggregate dollar value of any title deficiencies and  environmental liabilities exceeds $51.5 million, then, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement,  the Company may terminate the Asset Purchase Agreement upon payment of a termination fee of $20  million.  Each partys obligation to consummate the Acquisition is conditioned upon, among other things, (i)  confirmation of the counterparties representations and warranties as of the closing, (ii) the  counterparties performance, in all material respects, of all covenants, (iii) the receipt of all  required approvals and (iv) the absence of legal matters prohibiting the Acquisition.  Additionally, the Companys obligation to consummate the Acquisition is further conditioned on the  absence of a material adverse effect on the Sellers oil and gas business. The Company has agreed  to pay a termination fee of $20 million if the Asset Purchase Agreement is terminated in certain  circumstances (including by the Company for title deficiencies and environmental defects in excess  of $51.5 million, as described above).

The Asset Purchase Agreement is filed herewith to provide investors with  information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about  the Sellers or the Company. In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and  warranties contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement are qualified by information in confidential  disclosure schedules provided by the Sellers and the Company to each other in connection with the  signing of the Asset Purchase Agreement. These disclosure schedules contain information that  modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the  Asset Purchase Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Asset Purchase  Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk between the Sellers and the Company rather  than establishing matters of fact. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and  warranties in the Asset Purchase Agreement as characterizations of the actual statements of fact  about the Sellers or the Company.  Common Stock Purchase Agreement  On July 19, 2010, the Company also entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Stock  Purchase Agreement ) with certain unaffiliated third-party investors (the  Purchasers ) to sell  6,622,517 shares of the Companys common stock in a private placement (the  Private  Placement ) for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $300 million, for a negotiated price  of $45.30 per share. The Company anticipates that the Private Placement will close simultaneously  with the Acquisition.  The closing of the Private Placement is subject to customary closing conditions, as well as certain  other conditions, including (i) the closing of the Acquisition and (ii) the execution by the  Company and the Purchasers of a registration rights agreement that would require the Company to  file a shelf registration statement registering the resale of the  Purchasers shares within 90 days after the closing of the Private Placement.  The Private Placement is being made in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements  of the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof.

The Second Amendment increases the borrowing base from $955.9 million to $1.2 billion and the  lenders aggregate commitment from $960 million to $1.2 billion. Before the Second Amendment, the  borrowing base was to be automatically reduced by $0.30 for every dollar of senior notes issued by  the Company. As a result of the Second Amendment, however, the lenders are permitted to exercise  discretion and may reduce the borrowing base by $0.30 for every dollar of senior notes issued by  the Company or such lesser amount as determined by two-thirds of the lenders upon any such  issuance. The Second Amendment also increases the limit on the Companys aggregate outstanding  senior unsecured notes from $300 million to $600 million.  Before entering into the Second Amendment, the Company was permitted to enter into commodities  hedging arrangements with an aggregate notional amount for any given month during the succeeding  five year period that did not exceed 85% of the Companys expected production for such month. The  Second Amendment increases this monthly limitation on commodities hedging arrangements to 100% of  the Companys estimated production for any given month during the succeeding two year period. For  any given month during the remaining three years of the succeeding five-year period, the limitation  remains at 85% of the Companys estimated production for such month.

It is anticipated that Enstar and Allianz will enter into amended and restated governing documents with respect to Enhanzed Re in connection with the completion of Cavello Bay's purchase of the Enhanzed Re shares owned by HH ENZ. Following closing of the purchase of the Enhanzed Re shares, Enstar expects to consolidate Enhanzed Re. Enstar and Cavello Bay intend to fund the purchases under the EGL Agreement and the Enhanzed Agreement using cash on hand and $300 million in borrowings under Enstar's existing unsecured $600 million revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Credit Facility""). The EGL Agreement and the Enhanzed Agreement contain customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties.

The Junior Subordinated Notes were issued by Enstar Finance and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a junior subordinated basis, by the Company. In connection with the Offering, on August 26, 2020, the Company, Enstar Finance and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the ""Trustee""), entered into a first supplemental indenture (the ""First Supplemental Indenture"") to the junior subordinated indenture, dated as of August 26, 2020 (the ""Junior Subordinated Indenture""). The Junior Subordinated Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture set forth the terms and conditions of the Junior Subordinated Notes, including customary events of default and the rights and obligations of the parties thereto and the holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes. Copies of the Junior Subordinated Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture are filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 hereto, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. The Junior Subordinated Notes will bear interest (a) from the date of original issue to, but excluding, September 1, 2025 at the fixed rate of 5.750% per annum and (b) from, and including, September 1, 2025, during each five-year period thereafter, at a rate per annum equal to the Five-Year Treasury Rate as of two business days prior to the beginning of such five-year period plus 5.468% as reset at the beginning of each such five-year period. Interest will be paid on September 1 and March 1 of each year, commencing on March 1, 2021. If, as of any interest payment date, a Mandatory Deferral Event (as defined below) has occurred and is continuing, Enstar Finance and the Company will be required to defer payment of all (and not less than all) of the interest accrued on the Junior Subordinated Notes as of such interest payment date. A ""Mandatory Deferral Event"" will be deemed to have occurred if the Company or all of its subsidiaries that are regulated insurance or reinsurance companies (or part of such regulatory group) are in breach of the enhanced capital and surplus requirements under applicable insurance supervisory laws (the ""Enhanced Capital Requirements""), or would breach such Enhanced Capital Requirement if payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest on any junior subordinated notes outstanding that rank equally in right of payment with the Junior Subordinated Notes, were made. The Junior Subordinated Notes are scheduled to mature on September 1, 2040, if, on such date, certain redemption requirements are satisfied, or otherwise, following such scheduled maturity date, the earlier of (a) the date falling ten business days after the redemption requirements are satisfied and would continue to be satisfied if such payment were made and (b) the date on which a winding-up of the Company or Enstar Finance occurs (the ""Final Maturity Date""). The Junior Subordinated Notes may not be repaid prior to the Final Maturity Date if the Enhanced Capital Requirement would be breached immediately before or after giving effect to such repayment of the Junior Subordinated Notes, unless the Company, Enstar Finance or another subsidiary of the Company replaces the capital represented by the Junior Subordinated Notes to be repaid with capital having equal or better capital treatment as the Junior Subordinated Notes under applicable insurance supervisory laws. The Junior Subordinated Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture provide for the following events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods): nonpayment of principal or any premium when due (other than if Enstar Finance is required to postpone payment to satisfy certain redemption requirements); nonpayment of interest (except if due to a Mandatory Deferral Event); the Company's guarantee of the Junior Subordinated Notes ceases to be in full force and effect (other than a permitted release of the guarantee); or certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Enstar Finance or the Company. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes may declare the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the Junior Subordinated Notes to be due and payable immediately. 1 The foregoing descriptions of the Junior Subordinated Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture are qualified by reference to the agreements themselves, which are attached as exhibits to this report.",000136382920000184-1.01,1.01

(collectively, Trident) with respect to the previously announced acquisitions of Atrium Underwriting Group Limited (Atrium) and Arden Reinsurance Company Limited (Arden  Re), pursuant to which Trident acquired a 40% interest in Northshore Holdings Ltd., previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kenmare (Northshore). In connection with the Investors Agreement, Kenmare and Trident entered into  individual equity commitment letters to Northshore pursuant to which Kenmare and Trident agreed to provide 60% and 40%, respectively, of the Atrium and Arden Re purchase prices and related expenses. As previously announced, the purchase price for  Atrium will be approximately $183.0 million and the purchase price for Arden Re will be approximately $79.6 million.  Completion of Kenmares and Tridents funding obligations is conditioned on, among other things, the satisfaction of certain  conditions tied directly to the satisfaction of the closing conditions under the Atrium and Arden Re purchase agreements. In the event that the Arden Re acquisition closes, but the Atrium acquisition does not close, Tridents obligations under  its commitment letter would terminate as to both companies and Trident would return its 40% interest in Northshore to Kenmare.  Upon the funding of the equity commitments at the closing of the Atrium and Arden Re transactions, Kenmare and Trident have agreed to  enter into a Shareholders Agreement (the Northshore Shareholders Agreement). Among other things, the Northshore Shareholders Agreement will provide that Kenmare would appoint three members to the Northshore board of  directors and Trident would appoint two members. Trident would also have the right to designate one member of the Atrium board of directors.    The Northshore Shareholders Agreement includes a five-year period during which neither party can transfer its ownership interest in Northshore to a third party (the Restricted Period).  Following the Restricted Period: (i) each party must offer the other party the right to buy its shares before the shares are offered to a third party; (ii) Kenmare can require Trident to participate in a sale of Northshore to a third party  as long as Kenmare owns 55% of Northshore; (iii) each party has the right to be included on a pro rata basis in any sales made by the other party; and (iv) each party has the right to buy its pro rata share of any new securities issued by  Northshore.    During the 90-day period following the fifth anniversary of the earlier of the closings of the Atrium and Arden  Re transactions, and at any time following the seventh anniversary of the earlier of such closings, Kenmare would have the right to redeem Tridents shares in Northshore at their then fair market value, which would be payable in cash. Following  the seventh anniversary of the earlier of the closings, Trident would have the right to require Kenmare to purchase Tridents shares for their then current fair market value, which Kenmare would have the option to pay either in cash or by  delivering the Companys ordinary voting shares.    Acquisition of Torus Insurance Holdings Limited  On July 8, 2013, the Company, Veranda Holdings Ltd., an entity in which the Company owns an indirect 60% interest  (Veranda), Hudson Securityholders Representative LLC and Torus Insurance Holdings Limited (Torus) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Amalgamation (the Amalgamation Agreement). The Amalgamation Agreement  provides for the amalgamation (the Amalgamation) of Veranda and Torus (the combined entity, the Amalgamated Company). Torus is a global specialty insurer and holding company of six wholly-owned insurance vehicles, including  one Lloyds syndicate.    The purchase price for the Amalgamation is $692.0 million. The Company and Kenmare, on the one  hand, and Trident, the owner of the remaining 40% interest in Bayshore Holdings Ltd., the parent company of Veranda (Bayshore), on the other, will provide 60% and 40%, respectively, of the purchase price and related expenses  associated with the Amalgamation. The Company will issue a combination of approximately 1,901,000 voting ordinary shares, par value $1.00 per share (the Voting Ordinary Shares), and  approximately 711,000 newly-created Series B convertible non-voting preference shares, par value $1.00 per share (the Non-Voting Preferred Shares), having an aggregate value of approximately $346.0 million to partially fund the purchase  price. Kenmare will contribute in cash approximately $69.2 million and Trident will contribute in cash the remaining approximately $276.8 million of the purchase price. Following the Amalgamation, the Company and Trident will continue to own,  respectively, a 60% and 40% indirect interest in the Amalgamated Company through their ownership of Bayshore.    FR XI Offshore  AIV, L.P., First Reserve Fund XII, L.P., FR XII A Parallel Vehicle L.P. and FR Torus Co-Investment, L.P. (collectively, First Reserve) will receive Voting Ordinary Shares, Non-Voting Preferred Shares and cash consideration in the  transaction. In the event that the number of Voting Ordinary Shares deliverable to First Reserve at the closing of the Amalgamation would cause First Reserve, as of immediately after such closing, to beneficially own Voting Ordinary Shares that  constitute more than 9.5% of the voting power of all shares of the Company, then the Company will issue to First Reserve, at the closing, the total number of shares of Voting Ordinary Shares representing 9.5% of the voting power of all shares of the  Company as of immediately after the closing and Non-Voting Preferred Shares representing the remainder of the shares that First Reserve is entitled to under the Amalgamation Agreement. Corsair Specialty Investors, L.P. (Corsair) will  receive both Voting Ordinary Shares and cash consideration in the transaction. The remaining Torus shareholders will receive all cash. Following the Amalgamation, First Reserve will own approximately 9.5% and 11.5%, respectively, of the  Companys Voting Ordinary Shares and outstanding share capital and Corsair will own approximately 2.5% and 2.1%, respectively, of the Companys Voting Ordinary Shares and outstanding share capital.  Completion of the Amalgamation is conditioned on, among other things, governmental and regulatory approvals and satisfaction of various  customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2013.    The Company and First Reserve will  enter into a Shareholder Rights Agreement at the closing of the Amalgamation, under which the Company has agreed that First Reserve will have the right to designate one representative to the Companys Board of Directors. This designation right  terminates if First Reserve ceases to beneficially own at least 75% of the total number of Voting Ordinary Shares and Non-Voting Preferred Shares acquired by it under the Amalgamation Agreement.  The Company will also enter into a Registration Rights Agreement with First Reserve and Corsair at the closing of the Amalgamation that  provides First Reserve and Corsair with certain rights to cause the Company to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act), the Voting Ordinary Shares (including the Voting Ordinary Shares into which the Non-Voting  Preferred Shares may convert) issued pursuant to the Amalgamation and any securities issued by the Company in connection with the foregoing by way of a share dividend or share split or in connection with any recapitalization, reclassification or  similar reorganization (the foregoing, collectively, Registrable Securities). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company must file a resale shelf registration statement for the Registrable Securities within 20 business  days after the closing of the Amalgamation. In addition, at any time following the six-month anniversary of the closing of the Amalgamation, First Reserve will be entitled to make three written requests for the Company to register all or any part of  the Registrable Securities under the Act, subject to certain exceptions and conditions set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement. Corsair will have the right to make one such request. First Reserve and Corsair will also be granted  piggyback registration rights with respect to the Companys registration of Voting Ordinary Shares for its own account or for the account of one or more of its securityholders.  In connection with the Amalgamation Agreement, the Company, Kenmare and Trident entered an Investors Agreement governing their  investments in Bayshore, and Kenmare and Trident entered into individual equity commitment letters obligating each to fund its respective portion of the purchase price for the Amalgamation noted above. Completion of Kenmares and Tridents  funding obligations is conditioned on, among other things, the satisfaction of certain conditions tied directly to the satisfaction of the closing conditions under the Amalgamation Agreement.  2  Upon the funding of the equity commitments at the closing of the Amalgamation, Kenmare and  Trident have agreed to enter into a Shareholders Agreement (the Bayshore Shareholders Agreement). Among other things, the Bayshore Shareholders Agreement will provide that Kenmare would appoint three members to the  Bayshore board of directors and Trident would appoint two members.    The Bayshore Shareholders Agreement includes a  five-year period during which neither party can transfer its ownership interest in Bayshore to a third party (the Restricted Period). Following the Restricted Period: (i) each party must offer the other party the right to buy its  shares before the shares are offered to a third party; (ii) Kenmare can require Trident to participate in a sale of Bayshore to a third party as long as Kenmare owns 55% of Bayshore; (iii) each party has the right to be included on a pro  rata basis in any sales made by the other party; and (iv) each party has the right to buy its pro rata share of any new securities issued by Bayshore.    During the 90-day period following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Amalgamation, and at any time following the seventh anniversary of such closing, Kenmare would have the right to redeem  Tridents shares in Bayshore at their then fair market value, which would be payable in cash. Following the seventh anniversary of the closing, Trident would have the right to require Kenmare to purchase Tridents shares for their then  current fair market value, which Kenmare would have the option to pay either in cash or by delivering the Companys ordinary voting shares.

Dividends will be paid on the Non-Voting Preferred Shares when, as and if, and in the same amounts (on an as-converted  basis), declared on the Voting Ordinary Shares and/or non-voting ordinary shares.    Liquidation Preference . Upon  liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of Non-Voting Preferred Shares have the right to receive an amount equal to $0.001 per share. After payment of this amount, holders of the Non-Voting Preferred Shares are entitled to  participate (on an as-converted basis) with the Voting Ordinary Shares and the non-voting ordinary shares in the distribution of remaining assets.    Conversion . The shares of Non-Voting Preferred Shares issued to First Reserve pursuant to the Amalgamation Agreement shall automatically convert (i) into Voting Ordinary Shares upon the  transfer of such Non-Voting Preferred Shares to any person other than an Affiliate of First Reserve if that transfer qualifies as a widely dispersed offering and (ii) into a new series of non-voting ordinary shares of the Company upon the  approval by the Companys shareholders of an amendment to the Companys bye-laws to authorize such series. In such case, each Non-Voting Preferred Share shall initially convert into one Voting Ordinary Share or non-voting ordinary share,  as applicable, subject to adjustment for share subdivisions, splits, combinations and similar events.    Voting . The  Non-Voting Preferred Shares have no voting rights, provided that, the Company may not, without the consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Non-Voting Preferred Shares, voting separately as a class, (i) amend, alter  or repeal or otherwise change any provision of the Companys memorandum of  3  association, bye-laws or the Certificate of Designations for the Non-Voting Preferred Shares so as to significantly and adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or limited voting  rights of the Non-Voting Preferred Shares, (ii) consummate a binding share exchange or reclassification of the Non-Voting Preferred Shares, or a merger or consolidation of the Company (except for any merger or consolidation in which the  consideration consists solely of cash) unless the Non-Voting Preferred Shares remain outstanding or are converted or exchanged for a security with similar rights, preferences and privileges in the surviving entity and (iii) voluntarily  liquidate, dissolve or wind up the Company.    The foregoing summary of terms is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by,  the Certificate of Designations of the Non-Voting Preferred Shares, which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.    Amendment and Restatement of Revolving Credit Facility    On  July 8, 2013, the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries, as borrowers, as well as certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into an amendment and restatement of its existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement with National  Australia Bank Limited (NAB) and Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays), as mandated lead arrangers, NAB, Barclays and Royal Bank of Canada, as original lenders, and NAB as agent (the Restated Credit Agreement). The  Restated Credit Agreement provides for a five-year revolving credit facility (expiring in July 2018) pursuant to which the Company is permitted to borrow up to an aggregate of $375.0 million (the Credit Facility), which is available to  fund permitted acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. The existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement had provided for a three-year $250.0 million facility that was set to terminate in June 2014. The Companys ability to draw on the  Credit Facility is subject to customary conditions.    The Credit Facility is secured by a first priority lien on the stock of  certain of the Companys subsidiaries and certain bank accounts held with Barclays in the name of the Company and into which amounts received in respect of any capital release from certain of the Companys subsidiaries are required to be  paid. Interest is payable at the end of each interest period chosen by the Company or, at the latest, each six months. The interest rate is LIBOR plus 2.75%, plus an incremental amount tied to certain regulatory costs, if any, that may be incurred  by the lenders. Any unused portion of the Credit Facility will be subject to a commitment fee of 1.10%. The Credit Facility imposes various financial and business covenants on the Company, the guarantors and certain other material subsidiaries,  including limitations on mergers and consolidations, acquisitions, indebtedness and guarantees, restrictions as to dispositions of stock and assets, restrictions on dividends and limitations on liens.  During the existence of any event of default (as specified in the Restated Credit Agreement), the agent may cancel the commitments of the  lenders, declare all or a portion of outstanding amounts immediately due and payable, declare all or a portion of outstanding amounts payable upon demand or proceed against the security. During the existence of any payment default, the interest rate  would be increased by 1.0%. The Credit Facility terminates and all amounts borrowed must be repaid on the fifth anniversary of the date of the Restated Credit Agreement. ",000119312513286070-1.01,1.01

(AML Acquisition), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Enstar Group  Limited (the Company), as borrower, entered into a Term Facility Agreement with National Australia Bank Limited and Barclays Bank PLC (the SeaBright Facility). The SeaBright Facility provides for a four-year term loan  facility pursuant to which AML Acquisition is permitted to borrow up to an aggregate of $111.0 million, which will be available to fund up to 50% of the purchase price for the Companys previously announced agreement to acquire SeaBright  Holdings, Inc.

As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, AML Acquisition has not borrowed any of the amount available under the SeaBright Facility. Consummation of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of  certain regulatory approvals. The Merger is currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2013.    The SeaBright Facility  is currently secured by a security interest in all of the assets of AML Acquisition, as well as a pledge of the stock of AML Acquisition by its sole stockholder. Following completion of the Merger, SeaBright (as the survivor of the Merger) would  become the borrower under the SeaBright Facility and the facility would be secured by a security interest in all of the assets of SeaBright, a pledge of the stock of SeaBright by its sole stockholder, a pledge of the stock of SeaBright Insurance  Company, Paladin Managed Care Services, Inc., and PointSure Insurance Services, Inc. (which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of SeaBright) by SeaBright, and a security interest in all of the assets of Paladin Managed Care Services, Inc. and PointSure  Insurance Services, Inc.    From the date of the SeaBright Facility until the date that is one month after the completion of the  Merger, the undrawn and uncancelled amount of the SeaBright Facility will incur a fee of 1% per annum. Interest on amounts borrowed will be payable at the end of each interest period chosen by the borrower or, at the latest, each six months.  The interest rate will be LIBOR plus 2.75% for the first 18 months from the date on which the loan under the SeaBright Facility is made, and will increase to LIBOR plus 3.50% thereafter; the interest rate is subject to increase by an incremental  amount tied to certain regulatory costs, if any, that may be incurred by the lenders. The SeaBright Facility imposes various financial and business covenants on AML Acquisition (and, following completion of the Merger, SeaBright), including  limitations on mergers and consolidations, acquisitions, indebtedness and guarantees, restrictions as to dispositions of stock and assets (except for certain permitted dispositions), restrictions on dividends, and limitations on liens.  During the existence of any payment default, the interest rate would be increased by 1.0%. During the existence of any event of default  (as specified in the SeaBright Facility), the lenders may cancel their commitments, declare all or a portion of outstanding amounts immediately due and payable, declare all or a portion of borrowed amounts payable upon demand, or proceed against the  security. The SeaBright Facility terminates and all amounts borrowed must be repaid on the fourth anniversary of the date the term loan is made.

Enstar is a party to the acquisition agreement and has guaranteed the performance  by Holdings of its obligations thereunder.

At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of SeaBright common stock (other than shares held by SeaBright in treasury or held by stockholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand  for appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive $11.11 in cash, without interest (the Merger Consideration). Each outstanding option to purchase shares of SeaBright common  stock will fully vest at the effective time of the Merger and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration less the per share exercise price of the option. Each outstanding share of SeaBright restricted stock and  each SeaBright restricted stock unit will fully vest at the effective time and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Enstar expects to pay the aggregate purchase price of approximately $252 million through a  combination of cash on hand and a bank loan facility to be finalized before closing.    Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain  conditions, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by SeaBrights stockholders, the expiration or early termination of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period, receipt of certain regulatory approvals, the accuracy of the  representations and warranties of the parties (subject to materiality qualifications), the absence of any law or order prohibiting the Merger, the absence of any material adverse effect on SeaBright, material compliance by the parties with their  respective covenants and agreements under the Merger Agreement and certain other customary closing conditions.    The Merger Agreement includes  customary representations, warranties, and covenants of Enstar, Merger Sub, and SeaBright. In addition, SeaBright has agreed: (i) to cause a stockholder meeting to be held to consider adoption of the Merger Agreement and (ii) subject to  certain exceptions, that its board of directors will recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement to its stockholders.    Under the Merger  Agreement, SeaBright is subject to no-shop restrictions on its ability to solicit proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions and, subject to certain exceptions, enter into discussions, or enter into any agreement  concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, any proposals for alternative business combination transactions. Prior to approval of the Merger by SeaBrights stockholders, the no-shop provision is subject to a  fiduciary-out provision that allows SeaBright, under certain circumstances, to provide information to, and participate in discussions and engage in negotiations with, third parties with respect to an alternative business combination  proposal that its board has determined is, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). In addition, SeaBrights board may change its recommendation with respect to the Merger if it  determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would cause the board to breach its fiduciary duties under applicable law.    The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Enstar and SeaBright, including SeaBrights right to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances to enter into a  definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including as a result of a change in recommendation of SeaBrights board of directors with respect to  the Merger or if SeaBright enters into a definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, SeaBright would be required to pay Enstar a termination fee of $7.5 million.    The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and  incorporated herein by reference.    The Merger Agreement governs the contractual rights between the parties in relation to the Merger. The  Merger Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement and is not intended to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about Enstar or  SeaBright in Enstars or SeaBrights public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, the Merger Agreement is not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosure  regarding any facts and circumstances relating to Enstar or SeaBright. The representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement have been negotiated with the principal purpose of  establishing the circumstances in which a party may have the right not to consummate the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the  parties, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject to contractual standards of materiality different from those generally applicable under the securities laws. Investors in Enstars  securities are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties or  any of their affiliates.

The aggregate purchase price of $56,000,000 is payable by  the Company through promissory notes to each selling shareholder (each, a Promissory Note).  The Company agreed to repurchase an aggregate of 600,000 ordinary shares from Dominic F.  Silvester and R&H Trust Co. (NZ) Limited, as trustee of the Left Trust (the Left Trust). Mr.  Silvester is the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Mr.  Silvester and his immediate family are the sole beneficiaries of the Left Trust. Mr. Silvesters  beneficial ownership interest in the Company will be reduced from approximately 15.6% to 11.9% as a  result of the repurchase. The sales by Mr. Silvester are designed to reduce his holdings below 10%  after taking into consideration the 2,972,892 shares of nonvoting convertible ordinary shares of  the Company held by one of its subsidiaries (which shares are not considered to be outstanding for  financial reporting purposes). Mr. Silvester has informed the Company that he intends to become a  resident of the United States during 2011 or 2012, which will make Mr. Silvester a U.S. person  for purposes of the subpart F rules under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Under those rules, if  one or more U.S. persons that each own, directly or by attribution, 10% or more of a foreign  corporations outstanding shares, measured by voting power, own in the aggregate more than 25% of  the foreign corporations outstanding shares, by vote or value, the corporation will be a  controlled foreign corporation with respect to insurance income  which is generally defined  as insurance company income from insuring risks located outside its country of incorporation. In  that case, those U.S. shareholders must include in their taxable income each year their pro rata  share of the controlled foreign corporations insurance income even if that income is not  distributed. A substantial amount of the income normally earned by the Companys non-U.S.  subsidiaries that are insurance companies constitutes insurance income as so defined.  The Company believes that the nonvoting shares owned by its subsidiary do not affect the  determination whether the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a controlled foreign corporation,  and that the Companys bye-law restriction that caps any U.S. persons voting power with respect to  Company shares at 9.5% of the total voting power, coupled with pass-through voting for directors of  the Companys foreign subsidiaries, has operated and will continue to operate to preclude any U.S.  person from owning, directly or by attribution, more than 10%, measured by voting power, of the  shares of the Company or any of its foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Company believes that  the ownership of 10% or more of its ordinary shares by a U.S. person should not cause the Company  or any of its subsidiaries to be controlled foreign corporations. Nonetheless, it is possible that  Internal Revenue Service might disagree with these positions. Therefore, the Company believes it  is prudent to avoid a circumstance in which U.S. persons that own 10% or more of its outstanding  shares, by vote or value, own in the aggregate more than 25% of its outstanding shares. Because  the Companys subsidiary that owns the nonvoting convertible ordinary shares is a U.S. person, any  negative tax consequences from the Company becoming a controlled foreign corporation might impact  that subsidiary  and, hence, the Company, as well as Mr. Silvester. By repurchasing the shares  from Mr. Silvester, the Company eliminates any such tax exposure that might otherwise have resulted  from his move to the United States.  The Company also agreed to repurchase 100,000 of its ordinary shares from R&H Trust Co. (BVI)  Limited, as trustee of the Elbow Trust (the Elbow Trust). Paul J. OShea (the Companys Joint  Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President and a member of its Board of Directors) and his  immediate family are the sole beneficiaries of the Elbow Trust. In addition, the Company agreed to  repurchase 100,000 of its ordinary shares from Hove Investments Holding Limited (Hove). Nicholas  A. Packer (the Companys Joint Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President) and his  immediate family are the sole beneficiaries of a trust that is the sole owner of Hove. While the  shares held by Messrs. OShea and Packer do not present the same tax issues as Mr. Silvesters  holdings, the Company believed it was fair and appropriate to offer each of them, as Mr.  Silvesters co-founders of the Company, the opportunity to sell shares back to the Company on the  same terms offered to Mr. Silvester.  Closing of the repurchase transactions is expected to occur as soon as practicable. At the  closing, the Company will issue a Promissory Note to Mr. Silvester in the principal amount of  $4,789,260 and to the Left Trust in the principal amount of $37,210,740. The Company will issue  Promissory Notes to both the Elbow Trust and  2  Hove in the principal amount of $7,000,000. The annual interest rate for the notes is fixed at  3.5% and the notes are repayable in three equal installments on December 31, 2010, December 1, 2011  and December 1, 2012. The holders may accelerate amounts payable under the Promissory Notes upon  the Companys default in payment, a sale of all or substantially all of the Companys assets,  formal action in contemplation of the Companys dissolution or liquidation or the institution of  bankruptcy proceedings. The Company may prepay the Promissory Notes in whole or in part at any  time without premium or penalty.  In connection with the Repurchase Agreements, the Company will enter into lock-up agreements  with each of Messrs. Silvester, OShea and Packer, the Left Trust, the Elbow Trust, Hove, and a  separate trust of which Mr. Silvester and his immediate family are the sole beneficiaries. The  lock-up agreements prohibit future sales and transfers of shares now owned or subsequently acquired  for two years from the date of the Repurchase Agreements.  The Repurchase Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby were approved by the  Companys Audit Committee, which consists solely of its independent directors, on September 30,  2010. The closing price of the Companys ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on  September 29, 2010 was $72.11. The descriptions of the Repurchase Agreements are qualified in  their entirety by reference to the full text of the agreements, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1,  10.2 and 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.  In addition to the repurchases by the Company, Messrs. OShea and Packer have also entered  into agreements to sell 32,500 shares each at $70.00 per share to certain investment funds  affiliated with Akre Capital Management, LLC. Charles T. Akre, a member of the Companys Board of  Directors, is the managing member of Akre Capital Management, LLC. Mr. OSheas beneficial  ownership interest in the Company will be reduced from approximately 4.6% to 3.9% as a result of  the two transactions. Mr. Packers beneficial ownership interest in the Company will be reduced  from approximately 4.4% to 3.7% as a result of the two transactions.",000095012310090889-1.01,1.01

(""Innoviva"") completed its offering of $36.0 million aggregate principal amount  of its 2.125% convertible senior notes due 2028 (the ""Additional Notes""). The Additional Notes were sold to Goldman Sachs &  Co. LLC and Moelis & Company LLC (the ""Initial Purchasers"") pursuant to the Initial Purchasers' partial exercise  of their option to purchase such notes, granted in connection with the previously disclosed offering of $225 million aggregate principal  amount of Innoviva's 2.125% convertible senior notes due 2028 (the ""Initial Notes"" and, together with the Additional  Notes, the ""Notes""), which closed on March 7, 2022. The Additional Notes have the same terms, and were issued under the  same Indenture, dated as of March 7, 2022 (the ""Indenture""), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust  Company, N.A., as trustee, as the Initial Notes, as described in the Company's Current Report on  Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 8, 2022  (the ""Initial Form 8-K""). The information set forth in the  Initial Form 8-K  is incorporated herein by reference.  The Additional Notes were sold in a private offering  under a purchase agreement, dated as of March 2, 2022, entered into by and among Innoviva and the Initial Purchasers, for resale  to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act"").  The net proceeds from the sale of the Additional  Notes were approximately $34.5 million after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discounts and commissions and Innoviva's estimated  offering expenses and inclusive of accrued interest from the issue date of the Initial Notes. Innoviva used approximately $2.9 million  of the net proceeds from the offering of the Additional Notes to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described  below, and expects to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes.  Additional Capped Call Confirmations  On March 18, 2022, in connection with the  partial exercise by the Initial Purchasers of their option to purchase the Additional Notes described above, Innoviva entered into  additional privately negotiated capped call transactions,  on the same terms and with the same option counterparties as the capped  call transactions entered into by Innoviva in connection with the Initial Notes. The cap price of the capped call transactions is initially  $33.9850 per share, which represents approximately a 75.00% premium to the closing price of Innoviva's common stock on March 2,  2022, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions.

(""Innoviva"") completed its previously announced offering of $225 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.125% convertible  senior notes due 2028 (the ""Notes""). The Notes were sold in a private offering under a purchase agreement, dated as of March 2,  2022, entered into by and among Innoviva and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Moelis & Company LLC, as initial purchasers  (collectively, the ""Initial Purchasers""), for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the  Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). Innoviva also granted the Initial Purchasers an option to purchase,  for settlement within a period of 13 days from, and including, the date the Notes were first issued, up to an additional $45 million aggregate  principal amount of the Notes on the same terms and conditions.  The net proceeds from the sale of the $225 million  aggregate principal amount of Notes were approximately $216.8 million after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discounts and commissions  and Innoviva's estimated offering expenses. Innoviva used approximately $18.1 million of the net proceeds from the offering to  fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below. In addition, Innoviva used $165.6 million of the remaining  net proceeds to repurchase $144.8 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.125% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2023 (the ""2023  Notes"") in separate and individually negotiated transactions with certain holders of the 2023 Notes, which closed concurrently with  the issuance of the Notes. Innoviva expects to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes.  Indenture  On March 7, 2022, Innoviva entered into  an indenture (the ""Indenture"") with respect to the Notes with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee  (the ""Trustee""). Under the Indenture, the Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Innoviva and bear interest at a rate  of 2.125% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15,  2022. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2028, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted.  The Notes are convertible into shares of Innoviva's  common stock, cash or a combination of shares of Innoviva's common stock and cash, at Innoviva's election, based on an initial  conversion rate of 38.1432 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately  $26.22 per share), subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately  35.0% to the $19.42 per share closing price of Innoviva's common stock on March 2, 2022. The conversion rate is subject to  customary anti-dilution adjustments in certain circumstances.  Prior to September 15, 2027, the Notes will  be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of specified events and during certain periods, and will be convertible  on or after September 15, 2027 at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding  the maturity date of the Notes.  The Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part,  at Innoviva's option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 20, 2025 and on or before the 75th scheduled trading  day immediately before the maturity date but only if the last reported sale price per share of Innoviva's common stock exceeds 130%  of the conversion price for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be  redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, calling any Note for redemption  will constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion  rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.  If Innoviva undergoes a ""fundamental change""  (as defined in the Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders may require Innoviva to purchase for cash all or any portion of  their Notes. The fundamental change purchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus any accrued  and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events  with respect to the Company's common stock.  2  The Indenture contains customary terms and  covenants, including a merger covenant and that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the  holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare 100% of the principal of, and accrued  and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.  The above description of the Indenture and the  Notes is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture (and the Form of Note included therein), which  is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.  Capped Call Confirmations  On March 2, 2022, in connection with the  offering of the Notes, Innoviva entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with Bank of America, N.A., Goldman Sachs &  Co. LLC and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (the ""option counterparties""). The cap price of the capped call transactions is  initially $33.9850 per share, which represents approximately a 75.00% premium to the closing price of Innoviva's common stock on  March 2, 2022, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. The capped call transactions  cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock initially underlying the Notes. The capped call transactions  are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to Innoviva's common stock upon conversion of the Notes or at Innoviva's  election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments Innoviva is required to make in excess of the aggregate principal amount  of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap.  Innoviva has been advised that, in connection  with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect  to purchase shares of Innoviva's common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the common stock  concurrently with or shortly after the offering of the Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the  market price of the common stock or the Notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may  modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the common stock and/or purchasing or selling  the common stock or other securities of Innoviva in secondary market transactions following the offering of the Notes and prior to the  maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions and in connection with any early  termination event in respect of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the  market price of the common stock or the Notes, which could affect a noteholder's ability to convert the Notes and, to the extent the activity  occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes, it could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration  that a noteholder will receive upon conversion of the Notes.  In addition, if any such capped call transaction  fails to become effective, the option counterparty party thereto may unwind its hedge positions with respect to the common stock, which  could adversely affect the value of the common stock and, if the Notes have been issued, the value of the Notes.  The above description of the capped call transactions  is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Form of Capped Call Confirmation, which is attached hereto  as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.",000110465922031613-1.01,1.01

("" Innoviva "") entered into a strategic partnership with Sarissa Capital Management LP ("" Sarissa Capital "") designed to accelerate the execution of its strategy and enhance returns on its capital. The partnership comprises (i) a strategic advisory agreement, pursuant to which and subject to the terms set forth therein Sarissa Capital will assist Innoviva in the development of its acquisition strategy and (ii) an investment by Innoviva into an investment fund managed by Sarissa Capital to enhance returns on its capital, as further described herein. The partnership is part of Innoviva's continued focus on increasing shareholder value by diversifying its primary royalty management business that includes respiratory assets partnered with Glaxo Group Limited and optimizing its capital allocation, both through actively pursuing opportunistic acquisitions of promising companies and assets in the healthcare industry and enhancing the returns on its capital. Innoviva believes that Sarissa Capital's strategic position in the healthcare ecosystem, differentiated investment approach and strategic acumen are highly synergistic with our capital deployment strategy and position us well for value creation.    Strategic Advisory Agreement    As part of the partnership, Innoviva and Sarissa Capital entered into a Strategic Advisory Agreement (the "" Services Agreement ""), dated December 11, 2020, pursuant to which Sarissa Capital will provide a variety of strategic services to Innoviva in order to assist Innoviva in the development and execution of its acquisition strategy. Pursuant to the terms of the Services Agreement, and subject to the limitations set forth therein, Sarissa Capital will, among other things: (i) assist Innoviva in the development of an overall acquisition and investment process and strategy; (ii) advise Innoviva on market trends, market dynamics and merger and acquisition activity; (iii) identify potential transaction targets; (iv) assist in due diligence of transaction targets and the negotiation and execution of transactions; (v) advise on the growth and operational plans, performance and integration of target companies once an investment or acquisition is made; and (vi) assist in the identification of director and officer candidates for target companies. The Services Agreement provides for the development of an annual work plan to implement the strategic services, and regular collaboration between Sarissa Capital and Innoviva to discuss the work plan and refine the strategic services. Innoviva believes that the partnership will allow it to utilize the expertise and market reach of Sarissa Capital to optimize Innoviva's proprietary investment program, targeting strategic control investments in the healthcare industry, while also focusing on Innoviva's primary business of managing its valuable royalty portfolio.    The Services Agreement includes customary indemnification and exculpation provisions and is terminable by Innoviva at any time. In addition, Sarissa Capital may terminate the Services Agreement at any time in the event that one or more withdrawal requests to the Partnership (as defined below) are made which, in the aggregate, cause the value of the interest of Strategic Partners (as defined below) in the Partnership to be less than 50% of the initial subscription amount, as adjusted for any cumulative profits and losses.    Investment of Capital    In addition to the Services Agreement, as part of Innoviva's efforts to optimize its cash position and increase yield, on December 11, 2020, Innoviva Strategic Partners LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Innoviva ("" Strategic Partners ""), entered into a subscription agreement (the "" Subscription Agreement "") and an Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement (the "" Partnership Agreement "" and, together with the Subscription Agreement and the other instruments and agreements referenced therein or contemplated thereby, the "" Investment  - 2 -  Documents "") pursuant to which Strategic Partners became a limited partner of ISP Fund LP (the "" Partnership ""). The general partner of the Partnership (the "" General Partner "") is an affiliate of Sarissa Capital and, pursuant to an investment management agreement, Sarissa Capital will act as the investment adviser to the Partnership.    Pursuant to the Investment Documents, Strategic Partners made a $300 million initial contribution into the Partnership on a ""most favored nations"" basis. The Partnership was formed for the purposes of investing in ""long-only"" securities in the healthcare, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The Partnership Agreement provides certain limitations on the General Partner and the Partnership. Among other things and subject to the limitations set forth in the Partnership Agreement, without the prior approval of Strategic Partners, the Partnership may not participate in any borrowing, leverage or other credit arrangement, enter into certain transactions with Sarissa Capital or its affiliates or invest greater than 20% of the Net Asset Value (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) of the Partnership in the securities of any single issuer (measured at the time of acquisition), however we expect the Partnership's investments to be concentrated in a few larger positions in order to maximize the synergies between the Partnership Agreement, the Services Agreement and our overall acquisition strategy.    As compensation for the advisory services to be provided to the Partnership, the Partnership Agreement provides for Sarissa Capital to receive a customary management fee from the Partnership, payable quarterly in advance, measured based on the Net Asset Value of Strategic Partners' capital account in the Partnership. In addition, as more fully described in the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner is entitled to a customary annual performance allocation based on the Net Profits (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) of the Partnership during the annual measurement period (i.e., the excess during the relevant annual measurement period of (x) operating profits of the Partnership plus the realized and unrealized increase in the value of securities held by the Partnership over (y) operating losses of the Partnership plus the realized and unrealized loss in the value of securities held by the Partnership). The performance allocation is payable annually (or a shorter period solely with respect to capital withdrawn from the Partnership prior to  year-end)  and is calculated based on valuation determinations made by Sarissa Capital or a third-party administrator for the Partnership selected by Sarissa Capital. The foregoing is the sole compensation receivable by Sarissa Capital for the transactions described herein.    The Partnership Agreement includes a  lock-up  period of  thirty-six  months after which Strategic Partners is entitled to make withdrawals from the Partnership as of such  lock-up  expiration date and each anniversary thereafter, subject to a 25% gating provision. If Strategic Partners wishes to withdraw more than 25% of its capital, such request will be carried over to the successive quarter-end dates until settled in full over a maximum of four quarter-end dates with respect to withdrawal of the full capital account balance. Payments to Strategic Partners in respect of any withdrawal are to be made within 30 days following the relevant withdrawal effective date. In addition, the Partnership Agreement provides for withdrawal rights at any time upon the occurrence of Cause (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) or in the event of a Key Man Event (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) tied to Dr. Alexander Denner ceasing to be the Chief Investment Officer of Sarissa Capital or otherwise ceasing to oversee the investment activity of the Partnership. Following a withdrawal due to Cause or a Key Man Event, the Partnership is required to distribute withdrawal proceeds as promptly as reasonably practicable following the relevant withdrawal date and without the application of the 25% gate or the  lock-up.     The Partnership Agreement also provides that Strategic Partners may elect, from time to time, to receive annual distributions of Net Profits (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) net of accrued and reserved expenses and fees of the Partnership. The Partnership Agreement also requires the Partnership to make distributions to Strategic Partners as necessary to allow Innoviva to maintain compliance with the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.  - 3 -  The Partnership Agreement includes  co-investment  rights pursuant to which Strategic Partners is entitled to invest ratably in investment opportunities presented to the Partnership and other funds and accounts managed by Sarissa Capital, and capacity rights pursuant to which Strategic Partners is entitled to make additional investments into the Partnership on the same preferential terms. The Partnership Agreement also includes a customary ""most favored nations"" provision, pursuant to which and subject to certain limitations and conditions, Strategic Partners is entitled to receive the benefit of any more favorable terms or conditions (and any related negative terms or obligations) provided to investors in any other fund or account managed by Sarissa Capital or its affiliates pursuing substantially the same investment strategy.    In addition to the terms described above, the Investment Documents include other customary terms and conditions including representations and warranties, indemnities, exculpation, information rights and reporting obligations and allocation of third party expenses.    The execution of the Services Agreement and the Investment Documents was approved by a special committee of independent directors of the Innoviva Board represented by independent legal, financial and other advisors. Mark DiPaolo, Esq. and Odysseas D. Kostas, M.D., two of our directors, are partners of Sarissa Capital. Accordingly, these directors have recused themselves to date from any decisions relating to our investment in the Partnership or the Services Agreement.    The foregoing is a summary description of certain terms of the Services Agreement and the Partnership Agreement and does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Services Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, and the Partnership Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the risk factors described in the Annual Report on Form  10-K.     Risks Related to the Services Agreement    Under the Services Agreement with Sarissa Capital, we may rely on Sarissa Capital to assist in our strategic investing activity.    On December 11, 2020, we entered into the Services Agreement pursuant to which Sarissa Capital provides substantial assistance to us in connection with our control investing activity. Pursuant to the terms of the Services Agreement, and subject to the limitations set forth therein, Sarissa Capital will, among other things: (i) assist Innoviva in the development of an overall acquisition and investment process and strategy; (ii) advise Innoviva on market trends, market dynamics and merger and acquisition activity; (iii) identify potential transaction targets; (iv) assist in due diligence of transaction targets and the negotiation and execution of transactions; (v) advise on the growth and operational plans, performance and integration of target companies once an investment or acquisition is made; and (vi) assist in the identification of director and officer candidates for target companies. The services are provided by Sarissa Capital personnel and we have limited or no ability to control the manner upon which the services are provided. In the event that Sarissa Capital fails to adequately perform the required services, our investment activity operations and financial performance may be negatively impacted.  - 4 -  Risk Related to our Investment in the Partnership    Our investment into the Partnership could subject us to various risks and uncertainties, any of which could impact our investment results and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.    Historically, we have invested our cash reserves in short-term investments and marketable securities, primarily corporate notes, government securities, government agencies, and government commercial papers. On December 11, 2020, we entered into the Partnership Agreement and invested $300 million of our cash reserves to be managed by Sarissa Capital as the investment manager to the Partnership.    While we expect that our revenues will continue to be primarily derived from our royalty management business, as a result of this investment, we may derive a material portion of our income from assets managed by Sarissa Capital. The investment strategy of Sarissa Capital will focus on a concentrated portfolio of ""long"" positions in publicly or privately traded securities (debt or equity) and derivatives of, and other financial instruments related to, each of the foregoing, specifically in the areas of healthcare, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. The risks associated with this investment strategy may be substantially greater than the risks associated with traditional fixed-income investment strategies or other  low-yield  strategies.    We have limited rights to remove the general partner of the Partnership and do not have any right to participate in the management of the Partnership or the investment activity of Sarissa Capital. We are solely dependent on Sarissa Capital's management of our investment in the Partnership. We cannot provide assurance that Sarissa Capital will be successful in meeting our investment objectives. Unexpected market volatility or losses in the Partnership's securities portfolio could significantly and negatively affect our investment in the Partnership and therefore our investment results, financial condition or results of operations.    The Partnership Agreement limits our ability to withdraw our invested funds from the Partnership.    Under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, subject to limited exceptions, we are not entitled to withdraw our funds invested in the Partnership until expiration of a  ""lock-up""  period. Following the expiration of the  lock-up  period, we are able to make annual withdrawals subject to 25% gating provision such that we would receive our entire account in the Partnership over four fiscal quarters. Therefore, we are limited in our ability to obtain liquidity with respect to those funds and are further subjects to market fluctuations with respect thereto, particularly given the expected concentrated nature of the Partnership's portfolio.    Sarissa Capital intends to continue to manage other third party capital and is not required to dedicate any minimum amount of time to the Partnership.    In addition to managing the Partnership, Sarissa Capital, its principals and their affiliates may engage in investment and trading activities for their own accounts and/or for the accounts of third parties and is not required to afford the Partnership exclusivity or priority with respect to investment or trading activities. Affiliates of Sarissa Capital manage and expect to continue to manage other client accounts which have objectives similar to the Partnership. The Partnership Agreement does not include any specific obligations or requirements concerning allocation of time, effort or investment opportunities to us or impose any restriction on the nature or timing of investments for accounts that Sarissa Capital or its affiliates may manage.  - 5 -",000119312520316331-8.01,8.01

(Innoviva or the Company) entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (MSSF), as administrative agent and collateral agent, the other agents party thereto and the lenders referred to therein (collectively, the Lenders). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Lenders have provided $250,000,000 in senior secured first lien term loans (the Term Loans). The proceeds from the Term Loans will be used by the Company to  redeem in full the LABA PhaRMA sm  9.0% Fixed Rate Term Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes), issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of August 3, 2016 (as further amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time prior to its termination hereunder, the LABA Indenture), by and between LABA Royalty Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Innoviva (LABA Royalty Sub), as the issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank), as trustee of the 2029 Notes (in such capacity, the LABA Trustee), and to pay related fees and expenses.  The Term Loans bear interest based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured, at Innovivas option, at an alternative base rate equal to the highest of the (a) prime rate, (b)  1/2 of 1% per annum above the federal funds effective rate, (c) LIBOR for an interests period of one month plus 1.00% and (d) 2.00% (the Base Rate) or LIBOR, plus a margin. The margin for Base Rate borrowings under the Credit Agreement is 3.50% and for LIBOR borrowings under the Credit Agreement is 4.50%. Borrowings based on LIBOR under the Credit Agreement will be subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor. Interest for Base Rate-based loans is calculated on the basis of a 365/366-day year and interest for LIBOR-based loans is calculated on the basis of a 360-day year.  Subject to certain customary exceptions, all obligations of Innoviva under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by Innovivas wholly owned subsidiary, Advanced Medicine East, Inc., and will be required to be guaranteed by each of Innovivas subsequently acquired or organized direct and indirect restricted wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries whose assets or net revenues exceed 5% of the consolidated assets or net revenues, as the case may be, of Innoviva and its restricted subsidiaries (the Guarantors). Other domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exceptions, will be required to become Guarantors to the extent that domestic restricted subsidiaries excluded from such guarantee obligation represent, in the aggregate, more than 10% of the consolidated assets and more than 10% of the consolidated net revenues of Innoviva.  The obligations under the Credit Agreement are Innovivas and the Guarantors senior secured obligations, collateralized by a lien on substantially all of Innovivas and the Guarantors personal property and material real property assets (if any) (subject in each case to certain customary exceptions).  The Term Loans may be prepaid, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, except that (i) prepayments financed by the incurrence of lower-yielding indebtedness (other than in connection with certain change-of-control or transformative acquisitions) within six months from August 18, 2017 will be subject to a prepayment premium of 1.0% of the principal amount prepaid and (ii) lenders will be compensated for LIBOR breakage costs (if any).  The Term Loans mature five years following the effective date. The Credit Agreement requires quarterly principal payments equal to 2.50% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans.  Additionally, the Credit Agreement stipulates an annual principal payment of a percentage of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (ECF) to repay the Term Loans. The first ECF application date will be measured as of the end of fiscal year 2018 and the ECF percentage is scheduled to be 50% if the consolidated first lien secured leverage ratio of the Company as of the last day of the applicable fiscal year is greater than 1.55 to 1.00, 25% if the consolidated first lien secured leverage ratio of the Company as of the last day of the applicable fiscal year is less than or equal to 1.55 to 1.00 but greater than 0.55 to 1.00 and 0% otherwise.  2  The Term Loans are also subject to prepayment from (i) the net cash proceeds of certain debt incurred or issued by Innoviva and its restricted subsidiaries and (ii) the net cash proceeds received by Innoviva or its restricted subsidiaries from certain assets sales and recovery events, subject to certain reinvestment rights.  Innoviva can request, at any time and from time to time, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, the establishment of one or more incremental term loan facilities with commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed, (i) (x) in the case of incremental term loans secured on a pari passu basis with the Term Loans, an amount such that the consolidated first lien secured leverage ratio of the Company calculated on a pro forma basis would not be greater than 2.00 to 1.00 or (y) in the case of incremental term loans secured on a junior basis to the Term Loans or unsecured, an amount such that the consolidated leverage ratio of the Company calculated on a pro forma basis would not be greater than 3.56 to 1.00, plus (ii) the greater of (x) $75,000,000 and (y) 45% of the prior four quarters consolidated EBITDA of the Company, plus (iii) the amount of any voluntary prepayments of the Term Loans other  than such voluntary prepayments financed with the proceeds of long term indebtedness. Lenders are not obligated to commit to provide any such incremental term loan facility requested by Innoviva.  The Credit Agreement also contains restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, Innovivas ability and that of Innovivas restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity, pay dividends or make other distributions or other restricted payments, make certain investments, create restrictions on distributions from subsidiaries (including prepayments of junior indebtedness), amend the terms of certain other indebtedness, create liens on certain assets, sell certain assets, consolidate, merge, liquidate, dissolve, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, enter into certain hedging arrangements, alter its line of business and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including upon the failure to make timely payments under the Credit Agreement or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy certain covenants, the occurrence of a change of control and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency.  The Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default, including: non-payment of principal, interest or other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement or related loan document; violation of covenants; material inaccuracy of representations or warranties; cross default to other material indebtedness; certain bankruptcy and insolvency events; certain ERISA events; material invalidity of guarantees or security interests; failure of the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement and related loan documents to constitute senior indebtedness with respect to the Companys 2.125% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2023; material judgments; and change of control.

(Innoviva or the Company) completed its previously announced offering of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the Notes). The Notes were sold in a private placement under a purchase agreement, dated as of August 1, 2017, entered into by and among Innoviva and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as initial purchasers (collectively, the Initial Purchasers), for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Innoviva also granted the Initial Purchasers a right to purchase, within a 30-day period, up to an additional $17.5 million principal amount of additional Notes on the same terms and conditions, which the Initial Purchasers exercised in full on August 4, 2017 and which additional purchase was also completed on August 7, 2017.  The net proceeds from the sale of the $192.5 million aggregate principal amount of Notes were approximately $187.3 million after deducting the Initial Purchasers discounts and commissions and Innovivas estimated offering expenses. Innoviva used approximately $17.5 million of the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase 1,317,771 shares of its common stock, at a price per share of $13.28, concurrently with the pricing of the offering of the Notes in privately negotiated transactions effected through one of the Initial Purchasers or its affiliate, as Innovivas agent. Innoviva currently intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds of this offering to repay a portion of the principal outstanding under the Companys LABA PhaRMA SM  9.0% Fixed Rate Term Notes due 2029 on the next interest payment date of August 15, 2017.  Indenture  On August 7, 2017, Innoviva entered into an indenture (the Indenture) with respect to the Notes with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee). Under the Indenture, the Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Innoviva and bear interest at a rate of 2.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2018. The Notes will mature on August 15, 2025, unless earlier repurchased or converted.  The Notes are convertible into shares of Innovivas common stock, cash or a combination of shares of Innovivas common stock and cash, at Innovivas election, based on an initial conversion rate of 57.9240 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $17.26 per share), subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 30% to the $13.28 per share closing price of Innovivas common stock on August 1, 2017.  Prior to February 15, 2025, the Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of specified events and during certain periods, and will be convertible on or after February 15, 2025 at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Notes.  If certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change as set forth in the Indenture occur prior to the maturity date, the conversion rate may, in certain circumstances, be increased for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such corporate event.  The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution provisions.  The Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity, and no sinking fund is provided for the Notes. If Innoviva undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the Indenture, subject to certain conditions, holders may require Innoviva to purchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes. The fundamental change purchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date.  The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.  2  The above description of the Indenture and the Notes is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture (and the Form of Note included therein), which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.",000110465917049927-1.01,1.01

In addition, on July 31, 2017, the Company issued a press release announcing that it has launched the refinancing of its 2029 Notes by initially offering, subject to market conditions and other factors, $175 million of convertible senior notes due 2025 (the Notes) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The Company may also purchase shares of its common stock in privately negotiated transactions in connection with the offering of the Notes.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.  The Company plans to enter into a term loan facility in an amount of up to $250,000,000 (the Term Loans) for the purpose of redeeming any 2029 Notes not otherwise redeemed with the proceeds of the offering of the Notes and paying fees and expenses in connection with such redemption. The Term Loans are expected to be secured by a security interest in substantially all of the Companys and the guarantors assets and guaranteed by each of our wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to customary exceptions).  The Term Loans will be  pari passu  in right of payment with the Notes, and the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the Term Loans (the Collateral) and structurally subordinated to the extent of the value of the guarantees.  The Term Loans are expected to include usual and customary negative covenants which are expected to include (but are not limited to) restrictions on the Companys ability to redeem or repurchase the notes.  The Term Loans are expected to include the following events of default (in each case, with customary exceptions, limitations and qualifications): nonpayment of principal, interest or fees; failure to perform negative covenants and affirmative covenants to provide notice of default or maintain the Companys existence; incorrectness of representations and warranties in any material respect; cross default and/or cross acceleration to material indebtedness; bankruptcy and insolvency; material monetary judgments; ERISA events; invalidity of material guarantees or security documents; loss of liens or perfection with respect to a material portion of the Collateral; and change of control.

(Innoviva or the Company) issued a press release (the Press Release) in response to the notice of nomination made by Sarissa Capital Domestic Fund LP and certain of its affiliates (together, Sarissa) regarding its intention to nominate four director candidates for election to Innovivas Board of Directors (the Board of Directors) at the Companys 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the Annual Meeting) described in this Current Report on Form 8-K. A copy of this press release is filed hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The Company also posted to the Companys website an infographic which contains information on the Companys fiscal year 2016 financial results. A copy of this infographic is filed as Exhibit 99.2. The Companys stockholders are not required to take any action at this time.  In light of Sarissas  intention to nominate four director candidates for election to Innovivas Board of Directors at the Annual Meeting, the Company is updating the risk factors that appear under the heading Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock in all quarterly and annual reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), subsequent to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The following risk factor shall be incorporated by reference into all of the Companys registration statements under the Securities Act. Investors in our common stock should carefully consider this risk factor below as well as all other risk factors disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the other information disclosed by us before making an investment decision.  Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders, including a potential proxy contest at our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders (the Annual Meeting).  Proxy contests have been waged against many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry over the last several years.  We have been the subject of actions taken by activist stockholders.  On February 8, 2017, Sarissa Capital Domestic Fund LP and certain of its affiliates (together, Sarissa), which on that date reported beneficial ownership of approximately 3.9% of our outstanding common stock, delivered a notice (the Notice), dated February 7, 2017, to the Company indicating Sarissas intent to nominate four candidates to stand for election as directors at the Annual Meeting.  In the Notice, Sarissa also notified us that it would present for a vote of stockholders a proposal calling for repeal of any provision of our amended and restated bylaws in effect at the time of the Annual Meeting that was not included in our amended and restated bylaws publicly filed with the SEC on or prior to February 6, 2017.  Following a thorough review of Sarissas nominees by our Board of Directors and the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors, our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote for all of the Board of Directors nominees and against all of Sarissas nominees. As a result of Sarissas Notice, or if other activist activities ensue, the Company may be engaged in a proxy contest at the Annual Meeting. Responding to a proxy contest or other similar actions by activist stockholders would require us to incur significant professional fees (including, but not limited to, legal fees, fees for financial advisors, fees for investor relations advisors, and proxy solicitation expenses) and the time-consuming nature of any such response may significantly divert the attention of management, the Board of Directors and our employees. Further, any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control resulting from any proxy contest or similar actions by activist stockholders could result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.  Even if we are successful in any proxy contest, including the potential proxy contest against Sarissa, our business could be adversely affected by any such proxy contest because:  *                    responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly (resulting in significant professional fees and proxy solicitation expenses) and time-consuming, disrupting operations and diverting the attention of our Board of Directors, management and employees;  2  *                    perceived uncertainties as to future direction may result in the loss of potential acquisitions, collaborations or other strategic opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners;  *                    if individuals are elected to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders; and  *                    if individuals are elected to our Board of Directors who do not agree with our strategic plan, the ability of our Board of Directors to function effectively could be adversely affected, which could in turn adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  Uncertainties related to, or the results of, such actions could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility.  In addition, under certain circumstances arising out of or related to a proxy contest or threatened proxy contest or the nomination of directors by an activist stockholder, a change in the composition of our Board of Directors may (1) trigger the requirement that we make an offer to repurchase all of our outstanding 2.125% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2023 (the Notes) at a price equal to 100% of the principal and unpaid interest on such Notes, (2) constitute a change in control under the terms of our severance plans, which provide for payment of severance if a covered executive officer is subject to an involuntary termination within 3 months prior to or 24 months after a change in control of the Company and (3) constitute a change in control under the terms of certain of the Companys equity award grants and equity plans for its employees, and depending on the terms of the award or plan, may result in the accelerated vesting of such award.  In the event we were required to offer to repurchase all of the Notes, which as of December 31, 2016 had an aggregate outstanding principal of approximately $241.0 million, we would be required to obtain additional financing. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $150.4 million. We cannot assure stockholders that we would be able to timely obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or equity-linked securities, the issuance of those securities could result in substantial dilution for our current stockholders and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our current stockholders. Furthermore, the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline and existing stockholders may not agree with our financing plans or the terms of such financings. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with partners or otherwise that may require us to relinquish rights to our intellectual property, our product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.  The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could materially adversely affect our business  Important Additional Information and Where to Find It  The Company, its directors and certain of its executive officers and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from stockholders in connection with the Companys 2017 annual meeting of stockholders (the 2017 Annual Meeting). On March 7, 2017, the Company filed a preliminary proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the 2017 Annual Meeting.

The Company intends to fund this program using its working capital.

The Company will determine when, if and how to proceed with any repurchase transactions under the program, as well as the amount of any such repurchase transactions, based upon, among other things, the results of the tender offer and the Companys evaluation of its liquidity and capital needs (including for strategic and other opportunities), its business, results of operations, and financial position and prospects, general financial, economic and market conditions, prevailing market prices for the Companys shares of common stock, corporate, regulatory and legal requirements, and other conditions and factors deemed relevant by the Companys management and Board of Directors from time to time.

(Theravance Biopharma) ordinary shares to our stockholders, and through June 2, 2014, the distribution date for such dividend, our common stock will trade regular way with the symbol THRX. On the regular way market, from the record date through the distribution date, shares of our common stock will trade with an entitlement to the Theravance Biopharma ordinary shares to be distributed in connection with the spin-off. After the distribution date, shares of our common stock will trade without an entitlement to the Theravance Biopharma ordinary shares distributed in connection with the spin-off. Therefore, if you owned shares of our common stock at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on May 15, 2014, the record date, and sell those shares on the regular way market prior to or on June 2, 2014, the distribution date, you also will be selling your right to receive Theravance Biopharma ordinary shares that would have been distributed to you in connection with the spin-off.  On May 16, 2014, our common stock also became available to trade on an ex-distribution when-issued market with the symbol THRXV.

Adjustment Period for Our 2.125% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2023  We expect that the conversion rate adjustment with respect to our 2.125% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2023 that will result from our spin-off of Theravance Biopharma will be based on the ten consecutive trading day period commencing on and including June 3, 2014, which is the first date on which shares of our common stock are expected to trade on Nasdaq, regular way, without the right to receive the dividend of Theravance Biopharma ordinary shares.

Simultaneously with the Note Purchase Agreements, the Company entered into a series of related agreements to support and effectuate the issuance and sale of the Notes.  Pursuant to the Sale and Contribution Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2014, (the Sale and Contribution Agreement), between the Company, as the transferor, and the Issuer, as the transferee, the Company sold and contributed to the Issuer all of its right, title and interest in, to and under the Collaboration Agreement and all of its rights and obligations thereunder other than certain excluded rights and obligations described herein; provided, that the Company will continue to receive all of the amounts paid by the Counterparty pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement other than the Retained Royalty Payments subject to the agreement of the Company to continue to perform all of the obligations (including the payment obligations) due to the Counterparty under the Collaboration Agreement.

The Notes may be redeemed at any time prior to maturity, in whole or in part, at specified redemption premiums. The Notes bear an annual interest rate of 9%, with interest and principal paid quarterly beginning November 15, 2014.  Prior to May 15, 2016, in the event that the specified portion of royalties received in a quarter is less than the interest accrued for the quarter, the principal amount of the Notes will increase by the interest shortfall amount for that period.  Since the principal and interest payments on the Notes are based on royalties from product sales, which will vary from quarter to quarter, the Notes may be repaid prior to the final maturity date in 2029.  Net proceeds of the offering are expected to be approximately $434.3 million; however, $32 million of such proceeds have been deposited into a milestone payment reserve account to fund 40% of any future milestone payments owing to the Counterparty under the Collaboration Agreement.

(the Company) entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the Underwriting Agreement) with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as the representative of the several underwriters listed therein (collectively, the Underwriters), relating to the sale of $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its convertible subordinated notes due 2023 (the Notes) and the grant to the Underwriters of an option, exercisable for up to 30 days, to purchase up to an additional $37.5 million aggregate principal amount of Notes.  On January 18, 2013, the Underwriters exercised this option in full.  The Underwriting Agreement contains other terms and conditions, including indemnification rights and obligations of the parties thereto, that are generally customary for transactions of this nature. The transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement are expected to close on January 24, 2013, subject to customary closing conditions. The foregoing description of terms of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report and is incorporated herein by reference.  The offering was made pursuant to the Companys automatically effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-186058) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on January 16, 2013, including a final prospectus dated January 17, 2013 filed with the SEC on January 18, 2013 pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  Capped Call Confirmations  In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company has also entered into capped call option transactions (the Capped Call Transactions) with Bank of America, N.A. (the Hedge Counterparty).  The  aggregate cost of the Capped Call Transactions is $36.8 million.   The Capped Call Transactions have a strike price of $27.79 per share of the Companys common stock, which represents approximately a 32.5% premium to the closing price of the Companys common stock price on January 17, 2013 and a cap price of $38 per share of the Companys common stock, which represents approximately an 81.2% premium to the closing price of the Companys common stock price on January 17, 2013.  The Capped Call Transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments similar to those contained in the Notes, approximately 10.3 million shares of the Companys common stock.  The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market price of the Companys common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions, which initially corresponds to the conversion price of the Notes, and is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.  2  However, upon conversion of a Note, the number of shares that the Company will be required to deliver will exceed the number of shares the Company is entitled to receive under the Capped Call Transactions by at least a number of shares with a value (determined in accordance with the Capped Call Transactions) of $1,000.  Therefore, any conversion of Notes will cause dilution to the Companys common stock, even after taking into account any shares received under the Capped Call Transactions.  In addition, if the market price of the Companys common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions, the number of shares of common stock the Company would receive under the Capped Call Transactions would be less than the number of shares it would be required to deliver to converting holders minus a number of shares with a value (determined in accordance with the Capped Call Transactions) of $1,000, which would increase the net dilution to the Companys common stock.  The Capped Call Transactions will be automatically exercised upon conversion of the Notes at maturity, subject to certain conditions. The Company will not be required to make any cash payments to the Hedge Counterparty or any of its affiliates upon the exercise of such options, but will be entitled to receive from the Hedge Counterparty a number of shares of the Companys common stock based on the amount by which the market price of the Companys common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions during a specified averaging period under the Capped Call Transactions. However, if the market price of the Companys common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions during such averaging period under the Capped Call Transactions, the number of shares of common stock the Company could expect to receive upon exercise of the Capped Call Transactions will be capped based on the amount by which the cap price exceeds the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions.  For any conversions of Notes prior to the close of business of the 95th scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, including without limitation upon an acquisition of the Company or similar business combination, a corresponding portion of the Capped Call Transactions will be terminated.  Upon such termination, the portion of the Capped Call Transactions being terminated will be settled at fair value (subject to certain limitations), which the Company expects to receive from the Hedge Counterparty, and no payments will be due to the Hedge Counterparty.  The Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions entered into by us with the Hedge Counterparty, are not part of the terms of the Notes and will not change the holders rights under the Notes.  The description of the Capped Call Transactions in this report is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the form of Base Capped Call Transaction and Additional Capped Call Transaction filed as Exhibit 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this report.  3",000110465913003879-1.01,1.01
